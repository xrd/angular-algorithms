  <b>Optimal substructure</b>
  Solution to entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems.
  <b>Bellman Equation</b>
  Functional equation: writes the value of a decision problem at a certain point
  in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the value of the remaining
  decision problem that results from those choices.
  Breaks problem into smaller problems, using Bellman's Principle of Optimality.
  <b>Principle of Optimality</b>
  An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decisions are, the remaining
  decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regards to the state resulting from the initial decision.
